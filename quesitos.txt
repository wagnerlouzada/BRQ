Question 1. Identify the categories of trades in a bank´s portfolio.
 
A bank has a portfolio of thousands of trades and they need to be categorized.
A trade is a commercial negotiation between a bank and a client.
Each trade has a value that indicates the transaction amount in dollars and a text
indicating if the client´s sector is "Public" or "Private". They implement the
following interface:
 
interface ITrade
{
    double Value { get; }
    string ClientSector { get; }
}
 
Currently, there are three categories rules:
LOWRISK: Trades with value less than 1,000,000 and client from Public Sector
MEDIUMRISK: Trades with value greater than 1,000,000 and client from
Public Sector
HIGHRISK: Trades with value greater than 1,000,000 and client from Private
Sector
 
Imagine you receive a list of trades and you need to return a list of categories as
below:
input: List<ITrade> portfolio
output: List<string> tradeCategories
 
Example:
Input:
Trade1 {Value = 2000000; ClientSector = "Private"}
Trade2 {Value = 400000; ClientSector = "Public"}
Trade3 {Value = 500000; ClientSector = "Public"}
Trade4 {Value = 3000000; ClientSector = "Public"}
portfolio = {Trade1, Trade2, Trade3, Trade4}
 
Output:
tradeCategories = {"HIGHRISK", "LOWRISK", "LOWRISK", "MEDIUMRISK"}
 
Your design must take into account category rules can be
added/removed/modified and will become highly complex
in the near future.
Please write your answer in pseudo-code showing clearly
what classes, interfaces, methods and design patterns you
would create/use to solve this problem. Also, object oriented
programming is appreciated.
